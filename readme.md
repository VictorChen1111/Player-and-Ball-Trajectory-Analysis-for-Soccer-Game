## Introduction

Understanding player and ball trajectories is crucial for soccer coaches, analysts, and enthusiasts. This project leverages computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to track and analyze player and ball movements in a soccer game. By extracting valuable data from video footage, the project allows users to gain insights into various aspects of the game, such as player positioning, passing patterns, ball trajectory, and more.

## Features

- **Trajectory Tracking**: The project uses computer vision techniques to track the movement of players and the ball throughout a soccer game, providing accurate trajectory information.

- **Data Visualization**: The tracking data is visualized using interactive line connections. You can click on the player you want to connect and see their formation changing, making it easy to interpret and analyze the patterns.

- **Bird's Eye View**: In addition to line connections, the visualization includes a bird's eye view perspective. This allows you to observe the players' movements and formations from an overhead angle, providing a comprehensive view of the game.
